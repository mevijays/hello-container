# Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up Azure OpenAI Service in Azure Portal for Your Solution

This guide will help you configure Azure OpenAI in the Azure Portal, enabling you to leverage powerful large language models for your multilingual, AI-powered financial advisory platform.

## 1. Sign In and Access Azure Portal

- Go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
- Log in with your organizational Azure account that has appropriate permissions for resource creation.

## 2. Create Azure OpenAI Resource

1. **Start New Resource Creation**
   - In the left sidebar, click **Create a resource**.
   - In the search bar, type **Azure OpenAI**.
   - Select **Azure OpenAI** from the search results and click **Create**.

2. **Configure Basic Settings on the "Basics" Tab**
   - **Subscription:** Select the Azure subscription you want to use (must be a paid subscription).
   - **Resource Group:** Choose an existing resource group or create a new one to organize your resource.
   - **Region:** Choose the Azure region closest to your users or compliant with your data residency requirements (e.g., East US, West Europe).
   - **Name:** Enter a globally unique name for this resource, such as `MyOpenAIResource`.
   - **Pricing Tier:** Choose the available tier (typically **Standard S0**).

3. **Networking Configuration**
   - In the **Networking** tab, select the appropriate option for your scenario.
     - For most development and testing, select **All networks, including the Internet, can access this resource**.
     - For production, consider restricting access via Virtual Networks or firewalls as needed.

4. **Tags (Optional)**
   - Add tags to categorize your resource for billing or management purposes if desired.

5. **Review + Create**
   - Review all configuration details.
   - Click **Create** to deploy the Azure OpenAI resource.
   - Wait a few minutes until deployment completes successfully.
   - Click **Go to resource** once deployment finishes.

## 3. Retrieve API Keys and Endpoint

From your Azure OpenAI resource page:

- Navigate to **Keys and Endpoint** in the left menu.
- Copy the **Key1** (API key) – used to authenticate your API requests.
- Copy the **Endpoint URL** – base URL for calling Azure OpenAI APIs.
- Keep these credentials secure (consider storing them in Azure Key Vault).

## 4. Deploy an OpenAI Model

1. In the Azure OpenAI resource page, find and click on **Model deployments** under **Resource Management**.

2. Click **Manage Deployments** or **Create New Deployment**.

3. In the deployment creation panel:
   - **Select a model:** Choose an OpenAI model such as `gpt-35-turbo` (recommended for chatbot and conversational AI scenarios).
   - **Deployment name:** Enter a friendly name for your deployment (e.g., `gpt-35-turbo-deployment`).
   - Leave other defaults as-is and click **Create**.

4. After deployment, your model will be listed in the **Model deployments** page, ready for use.

## 5. Access Azure OpenAI Studio (Optional)

- You can visit [https://oai.azure.com/portal](https://oai.azure.com/portal) to visually manage your deployments.
- Select your resource and subscription.
- Use the provided playgrounds to test chat completions and completions interactively before integration.

## 6. Integrate Azure OpenAI with Your Application

- Use your **Endpoint URL** and **API Key** in your backend services to call Azure OpenAI, referencing the model deployment name you created.
- Call APIs such as `chat.completions.create()` specifying the deployment/model name.
- Follow best practices for prompt designing and incorporating financial advisory context.

## 7. Secure and Monitor Your Azure OpenAI Resource

- Use **Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to restrict who can manage or call the resource.
- Monitor usage and quotas via the **Metrics** and **Logs** sections in the Azure portal.
- Implement throttling and logging on your API gateway or backend to ensure responsible usage.
