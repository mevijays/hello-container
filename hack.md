# End-to-End Solution Plan: Financial Advisory Platform for Deutsche Bank Hackathon

## Overview

Build an intelligent financial advisory platform for Deutsche Bank customers that offers:
- Personalized financial education
- Investment suggestions based on savings, transaction history, and goals
- Assisted loan offerings using eligibility evaluation

**Toolstack:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP) + Azure (cloud, AI services)

## 1. Requirement Analysis

### Functional Goals
- Analyze customer financial data (savings, spend, income)
- Educate customers via AI (explainer tools, content recommendations)
- Suggest investments with personalized risk profiles
- Evaluate and assist with loan eligibility and application

### Non-Functional Goals
- Secure handling of financial data
- Scalability (multi-region, multi-customer)
- Fast, responsive (low-latency) UI

## 2. High-Level Architecture

```

- Use GCP or Azure API Gateway for routing.
- Stateless backend services; use serverless compute (Azure Functions / GCP Cloud Functions).
- Cloud AI Services for ML, NLP, recommendation APIs (Dialogflow, Azure AI, Vertex AI, Azure OpenAI).
- Secure storage for user data (Cloud SQL/Firestore/Blob Storage).
- Integrate with Deutsche Bank APIs or simulate them for hackathon.

## 3. Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Cloud Infrastructure

- Create GCP and Azure projects/subscriptions.
- Enable required APIs (Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, AI/ML services).
- Set up secure storage (GCP Firestore or Azure Cosmos DB).
- Enable authentication (OAuth2, preferably with SSO or social login).

### Step 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing

- Ingest sample user  transactions, savings, demographic info.
- Anonymize for privacy.
- Normalize and store structured data in DB.

### Step 3: API & Microservices Design

#### Core APIs
- **POST /profile** (create/update user profile)
- **GET /financial-education** (content recommendations)
- **POST /investments/suggest** (get investment options)
- **POST /loans/eligibility** (run eligibility check, start process)

Use OpenAPI/Swagger for designing APIs.

#### Cloud Deployment
- Deploy stateless business logic as serverless (GCP Cloud Functions/Azure Functions).
- API Gateway handles routing, auth, throttling.

### Step 4: Financial Education Engine

- Integrate Azure OpenAI or GCP Vertex AI for a conversational, educative chatbot:
  - Use prompt engineering for common finance questions.
  - Provide explainers, quizzes, interactive content (text or voice).
- Use Azure Language Understanding or GCP Dialogflow CX for NLP.

### Step 5: Investment Advice Engine

- Build ML model (or rules-based if time-constrained):
  - Inputs: user savings, goals, risk appetite.
  - Outputs: asset allocation, suggested mutual funds, ETFs, bonds.
- Use Google Vertex AI or Azure ML to deploy recommendation model.
- Logic example:
  - If savings > ₹5,00,000 and age < 35, suggest equity-heavy.
  - If risk averse, suggest more debt/fixed deposits.
- Optionally, integrate with 3rd party data sources (market data APIs).

### Step 6: Loan Assistance Engine

- Build eligibility rules (salary, CIBIL score, repayment history).
- Use Azure Form Recognizer or Google Document AI for KYC/doc reading.
- Integrate credit score simulation (or dummy for hackathon).
- Provide step-by-step application journey and explain "why" for denials.

### Step 7: Front-End

- Quick mobile web app using React or Angular, utilizing GCP/Azure hosting.
- Workflow:
  1. Onboarding and consent
  2. Dashboard: “Your Financial Status”
  3. Ask your questions / Get advice (AI chat or cards)
  4. Explore investments / Apply for loans

### Step 8: Security & Compliance

- Store all sensitive data encrypted (at rest and transit).
- Use cloud IAM for access controls.
- Enable logging/auditing.
- Apply rate limiting and anti-abuse measures to APIs.

### Step 9: Deployment

- CI/CD with GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps pipeline.
- Auto-deploy to GCP Cloud Run/Azure App Service.
- Set up monitoring (Stackdriver, Azure Monitor).

## 4. Sample Code Snippets

**Example: Azure Function – Investment Suggestion (Python)**

```python
import azure.functions as func
import json

def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    data = req.get_json()
    savings = data.get('savings')
    age = data.get('age')
    risk = data.get('risk_profile')
    suggestions = []

    if risk == 'high' and age < 35 and savings > 500000:
        suggestions.append('Consider equity mutual funds and ETFs')
    if risk == 'medium':
        suggestions.append('Balanced mutual funds or debt-equity mix')
    if risk == 'low':
        suggestions.append('Fixed deposits, government bonds, recurring deposits')

    return func.HttpResponse(json.dumps({'investment_suggestions': suggestions}),
                             mimetype="application/json")
```

**Example: GCP Vertex AI Conversation (Python client)**

```python
from google.cloud import dialogflowcx_v3beta1 as dialogflow

def get_financial_advice(user_input):
    # Set up dialogflow agent and session
    # Make request with user_input and return response
    # This will be the interface for your education engine
    pass
```

## 5. UI Sample Flow

- **Login/Signup**
- **Dashboard:** "Your current financial health: ₹X in savings, Y% expenses, loan capacity"
- **Chat:** "How can I help you manage your finances today?"
- **Recommendation Cards:** "Based on your profile, you can consider..."
- **Apply for Loan:** Stepwise form with eligibility.

## 6. Quick Deployment Checklist

- Infrastructure live on GCP & Azure.
- Functions/services deployed, tested.
- Sample data loaded (user profiles, financial product info).
- API Gateway up and routing correctly.
- Front-end deployed and talking to APIs.
- Security baseline applied.
- Demo flow tested end-to-end.

## 7. Bonus Suggestions

- Multi-language support via cloud translation APIs.
- Gamification of financial learning.
- Personalized nudges via push/email (Cloud Pub/Sub or Notification Hubs).
- A/B test two education flows to see engagement.

## 8. Submission/Demo

- Prepare a live demo video (walkthrough of flows).
- Highlight unique architecture or AI use.
- Slides covering design, architecture, challenges, and next steps.

This roadmap covers all core steps and can be adjusted based on time, APIs available, and the hackathon's data openness. Let me know if you need code for a specific component or have a particular technical stack preference.
